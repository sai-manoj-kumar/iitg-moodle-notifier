IITG Moodle Notifier
====================

Notifies the user of any changes to their Moodle webpages of the courses to which they 
have subscribed to.

What is Moodle?
---------------

Moodle (abbreviation for **M**odular **O**bject **O**riented **D**ynamic 
**L**earning **E**nvironment) is a free source e-learning software platform, 
also known as a Learning Management System, or Virtual Learning 
Environment (VLE).([from Wikipedia][1])

Essentially it is an interactive website for Professors and Students for 
getting more out of their courses. Moodle is used for some courses in 
IIT Guwahati.

But unfortunately we have to frequently check the website by logging in(as we 
don't get any mail even for most important events), so IITG Moodle Notifier
(Google Chrome Extension) logins for you into the website and parse specific 
parts of HTML and notifies you if anything has changed.
